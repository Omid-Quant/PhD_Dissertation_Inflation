This project examines the impact of geopolitical risks on inflation using a Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) model. The analysis incorporates a 12-month lag structure and includes oil prices, exchange rate, industrial production, and interest rates as control variables.

 Key Highlights:
1- Implemented an SVAR model to assess the dynamic relationship between geopolitical risks and inflation.
2-  Analyzed monthly data to capture long-term and short-term effects.
3- Controlled for key macroeconomic variables such as oil prices and interest rates.
4- Provided insights into the role of global uncertainties in shaping inflation expectations.
